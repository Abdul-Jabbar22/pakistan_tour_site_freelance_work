                Present in the Gojal region of Hunza Valley, Gilgit Baltistan,
                the Attabad Lake was a beautiful accident of nature that happened in
                January 2010 due to a regional landslide. In the region of Gilgit Baltistan,
                this lake has attracted many tourists and provides many tourist activities including jet-skiing,
                fishing, and boating.
              </p>

              <p>
                The naturally created lake runs through Hunza Valley and now after 11 years,
                the Attabad Lake serves as a source of livelihood for many people as many guest
                houses and hotels are formed in the nearby region. The clear blue water surrounded
                by the snow-capped peaks of Karakoram mountains gives an appropriate description of poets’ imaginations.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ever since the creation of this eye-catching lake, it has served as a spot for tourist attractions.
                The color of the lake is unique and has developed an utter desire for tourists to witness this deep blue
                color,
                serving as a prime tourist and Instagram photo spot. The barren treetops in the middle of the lake give
                an insight into what led to the creation of this natural treasure.

              Swat Valley
            </h2>
            <p>
              In the northwestern region of Pakistan, Swat Valley is a true paradise that beckons
              travelers with its breathtaking beauty and rich history. Often referred to as the
              "Switzerland of the East," this enchanting valley is renowned for its lush green meadows,
              snow-capped peaks, and crystal-clear rivers that weave their way through the landscape.
              Swat Valley's natural splendor is simply awe-inspiring, providing a haven for nature enthusiasts,
              trekkers, and adventure seekers. From the towering mountains that offer thrilling
              trekking opportunities to the serene lakes that mirror the surrounding peaks,
              every corner of Swat Valley exudes an unparalleled charm.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Valley of Swat is delineated by natural geographic boundaries,
              and is centered on the Swat River, whose headwaters arise in the 18,000-19,000 foot tall Hindu Kush.
              The valley is enclosed on all sides by mountains, and is intersected by glens and ravines.
              Above mountains ridges to the west is the valley of the Panjkora River, to the north the Gilgit Valley,
              and Indus River gorges to the east. To the south, across a series of low mountains, lies the wide Peshawar
              valley.
            </p>

            <p>
              The northernmost area of Swat district are the high valleys and alpine meadows of Swat Kohistan,
              a region where numerous glaciers feed the Usho, and Gabral rivers (also known as the Utrar River),
              which form a confluence at Kalam, and thereafter forms the Swat river - which forms the spine
              of the Swat Valley and district.
